## Detecting Optimization Bugs in Database Engines via Non-Optimizing Reference Engine Construction

This paper describes NoREC, a metamorphic testing approach to detect optimization bugs, that is, logic bugs that affect the query optimizer. A preprint is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08292).

## Ternary Logic Partitioning: Detecting Logic Bugs in Database Management Systems

This paper describes TLP, a metamorphic testing approach that can detect various kinds of logic bugs and is applicable also to test features such as aggregate functions. A preprint is available [here](https://www.manuelrigger.at/preprints/TLP.pdf).
